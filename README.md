A portal (menu) for users that is capable of creating and manipulating
multiple entries of Stock and MutualFund Investments.

Assumptions and Limitations:
It is assumed that the user will pay attention to the program prompts. For inputs that require
a specific format, an example is displayed to the user. The limitations of the program rely heavily on
the ability of the user entering input of the wrong format (i.e. entering a String for a double input,
even when it is specified to enter a double).
